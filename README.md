## Detailed Project Description:

In this project, as part of my data analyst training, I worked on an international market analysis for La poule qui chante, a French agro-food company looking to expand its poultry exports. The objective was to identify clusters of countries that could be potential markets, using data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

### Key Tasks and Objectives:

1. Data Collection and Preparation:

    - Use FAO's New Food Balances data to perform exploratory data analysis and clean the dataset for further analysis.
  
    - Enrich the dataset with relevant external data sources, such as economic indicators, trade agreements, and regulatory information from open data platforms, to provide deeper insights into market conditions.
  
    - Identify and select relevant variables that could impact international poultry exports.

2. Clustering Analysis:

    - Perform hierarchical clustering to group countries based on key metrics.
      
    - Visualize the results using a dendrogram to understand how countries group together.
      
    - Apply the k-means clustering method to refine the grouping and compare the results with hierarchical clustering.
      
    - Analyze the centroids of the clusters to gain insights into each country group.

3. Dimensionality Reduction :

    - Conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize the clusters and understand the relationships between countries and key variables.

4. Reporting and Recommendations:

    - Present the analysis, methodology, and strategic recommendations to the management team, focusing on the most promising country clusters for international expansion.
      
    - Deliver a comprehensive notebook compiling analysis, visualisations, methods, and conclusions.

This project allowed me to refine my skills in clustering analysis, using both hierarchical methods and k-means, and to provide strategic market insights based on real-world FAO data.
